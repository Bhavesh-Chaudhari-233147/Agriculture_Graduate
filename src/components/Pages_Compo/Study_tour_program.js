                    Out of the 257 countries & territories that exist in the wide world, Israel is the only 
                    country whose Agricultural Technology is acclaimed across borders. In spite of having the 
                    smallest area & least rainfall, facing hardships like water shortages and engaged in enemy 
                    confrontation on all 4 sides, Israel is revered as the most progressive country when it comes 
                    to Agriculture. Tel Aviv, Israel’s economic & technological centre, is ranked among the best 
                    cities in the world. Anybody can float on Israel’s dead sea because of natural buoyancy. Israel 
                    is known worldwide for it’s cosmetics as well as science & high-tech industry. Israel is also home 
                    for many thinkers & innovators. Since 2012, Udyogbharati has taken the lead in organizing study tours
                     to Israel with the objective of exploring this great country & bringing the latest developments in 
                     Agricultural technology to the meadows of our local farmers.
